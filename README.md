# Course Material and FAQ for my Advanced CSS Course

This repo contains starter files and the finished project files for all the projects contained in the course.

Plus, I made all the course slides available for download, to make it easier to follow along the conceptual videos.

ðŸ‘‡ ***Please read the following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) carefully before starting the course*** ðŸ‘‡

## FAQ

### Q1: How do I download the files?

**A:** If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the complete package, hit the green button saying "Clone or download", choose the "Download ZIP" option, and you're good to go.

### Q2: One of the NPM packages is not working (compiling Sass, live-reload, etc). How to fix it?

Unfortunately, this is quite common. I listed some possible fixes [in this document](npm-fixes.md).

### Q3: I'm stuck in one of the projects. Where do I get help?

**A:** Have you extensively tried fixing the problem on your own? If you failed at fixing it, please **post a detailled description of the problem to the Q&A area of that video over at Udemy**, along with a [codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/) containing your code. You will get help as fast as possible! Please don't send me a personal message or email to fix coding problems.

### Q4: You keep mentioning your resources page. Where can I find it?

**A:** It's on my website at <http://codingheroes.io/resources>. You can subscribe for updates ðŸ˜‰

### Q5: What VSCode theme are you using?

**A:** I use Oceanic Next (dimmed bg) for all my coding and course production. [Here is my complete VSCode setup](vscode-setup.md).

### Q6: You use codepens in some of the lectures. Where can I find them?

**A:** They are all available on my [public codepen profile](https://codepen.io/jonasschmedtmann/pens/public/). The ones you're looking for might be buried under some newer ones.

### Q7: can I see a final version of the course projects?

**A:** Sure, I have an online version of all three. Here they are: [Natours](https://natours.netlify.com) (advanced CSS, Sass and responsive design), [Trillo](http://trillo.netlify.com/) (flexbox) and [Nexter](https://nexter.netlify.com/) (CSS Grid).

### Q8: The videos don't load, can you fix it?

**A:** Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about it. The course is hosted on Udemy's platform, and sometimes they have small technical issues like this one. Please just come back a bit later or [contact their support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us). Also, don't forget to select the HD option in the video player.

### Q9: Are the videos downloadable as well?

**A:** Yes, I made all videos downloadable on the Udemy platform so you can learn even without an internet connection. To download a video, use the settings icon in the right bottom corner of the video player.

### Q10: I love your courses and want to get updates on new courses. How?

**A:** First, you can subscribe to my email list [at my website](http://codingheroes.io/newsletter). Plus, I make important announcements on twitter [@jonasschmedtman](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman), so you should definitely follow me there ðŸ”¥

### Q11: Can I connect with your other students in some way?

**A:** Yep, I thought about this! I started quite an active Discord chatroom for you to chat with other students, help each other out or just hang out with like-minded people. You can [join using this invite](https://discord.gg/0ocsLcmnIZqxMSYD).

### Q12: How do I get my certificate of completion?

**A:** A certificate of completion is provided by Udemy after you complete 100% of the course. After completing the course, just click on the small trophy icon on the course overview page. If you want to change your name on the certificate, please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).
